Electric GeoDude is a private Streamlit web app designed to search through a geo-tagged database of leaked information.

Users can search by:
- Coordinates (with radius)
- Address
- Name
- ID

And instantly receive results displayed on an interactive map, without needing any SQL knowledge.

⚠️ **Note:** Because the app uses leaked data, it is **not publicly deployed** and is shown here **for demonstration and educational purposes only** — to showcase the technology, not the content.
